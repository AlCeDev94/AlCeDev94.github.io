            <p class="">I pursued a self-directed education in coding, blockchain, and decentralized technologies, which I later complemented with professional courses and hands-on project experience.</p>
            <p class="">I began teaching myself to code in 2019 while simultaneously exploring blockchain. Shortly after, I started my professional journey as a backend developer at a startup, where I quickly took on multiple roles â€” primarily focusing on <span class="dark-medium-white">full-stack development</span>.</p>
            <p class="">In 2022, driven by a deep passion and fascination for the potential of decentralized technologies, I decided to fully transition into the blockchain space.</p>
            <p class="">Since 2024, I've been gaining <span class="dark-medium-white">freelancing</span> experience as a blockchain developer.</p>          
            <p class="">Beyond my technical skills, I bring strong <span class="dark-medium-white">passion, reliability, and critical thinking</span>, along with a goal-oriented approach to problem-solving and excellent collaboration abilities.</p>
